      MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine Air Force confirmed Wednesday, March
      5, that search teams have located the wreckage of the FA-50 fighter jet
      that went missing Tuesday night, with both pilots found dead at the crash
      site in Bukidnon province. The wreckage was discovered in the vicinity of
      the Mt. Kalatungan Complex in Bukidnon on Wednesday following a full-scale
      search and rescue operation that involved over 100 personnel, according to
      the PAF. "With deep regret and profound sadness, the PAF announces the
      loss of the two pilots aboard," the PAF said in a statement. The FA-50
      fighter jet with tail number 002 lost contact with the rest of the flight
      involved in its mission "several minutes before they reached the target
      area of operations" past midnight on Tuesday. The jet was part of a flight
      providing air support for ground troops engaged in an operation in
      Bukidnon. An earlier PAF statement said it was engaged in "tactical night
      operations." The crash marks the first recorded accident involving the
      Philippines' FA-50 fleet since the aircraft were acquired between 2015 and
      2017. Following the incident, all 11 remaining FA-50 jets have been
      grounded pending a thorough investigation. PAF Spokesperson Col. Ma.
      Consuelo Castillo said they cannot "conclusive say anything" about the
      cause of the accident. "This will have to undergo thorough investigation.
      There could be various reasons why this happened," Castillo said.
      "Hopefully, through the investigation, we will know the real reason why
      this happened." The crashed FA-50 fighter jet was located using signals
      from the aircraft's emergency locator transmitter and locator beacons. The
      aircraft was "totally wrecked," said Armed Forces of the Philippines’
      Eastern Mindanao Command commander Lt. Gen. Luis Rex Bergante at a press
      conference on Wednesday. The remains of the two pilots were found inside
      the aircraft, Bergante said. According to the PAF, the search and recovery
      operation faced significant challenges due to the mountainous terrain and
      weather conditions. Over 100 rescuers, including special forces teams from
      the Philippine Army and civilian volunteers, were deployed to locate the
      crash site. Information from the crash site was described as
      "intermittent" due to weak signals in the area, which complicated initial
      assessment efforts. "We can't provide specific statements about the
      condition of the wreckage or details about the pilots yet, as we're still
      gathering all the facts," Castillo explained during the press conference.
